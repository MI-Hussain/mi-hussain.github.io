👋 Hello! I’m an artificial intelligence researcher with a decade of experience in computer vision and machine learning. Driven by a passion for tackling complex problems, my work spans diverse areas, including generative models for autonomous driving, Sensor Fusion, medical AI with a focus on computational pathology, and multispectral IR Cameras. You can explore my latest interests [here](/cv/#interests-1), and/or keep reading for a concise overview about me.

`Current Affiliations`

(1) I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) [Artificial Intelligence AI Graduate School (Machine Perception and Reasoning)](https://sites.google.com/view/mlv/people/alumni?authuser=0) since 2025. I collaborate mostly on computer vision, robotics, automation, and Agentic AI.

(2)  In addition, I am also affiliated with South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT through the [InnoCORE](https://www.msit.go.kr/eng/bbs/view.do?sCode=eng&mId=4&mPid=2&pageIndex=&bbsSeqNo=42&nttSeqNo=1128&searchOpt=ALL&searchTxt=innocore) (Innovation + Core Researchers) program: Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) Bio-Embodied Physical AI Research Group [Theme 3: Lightweight On-Device and Embedded AI](https://sites.google.com/view/dgist-innocore/faculty-members?authuser=0).

`Industry Experience after PhD`
As a Postdoctoral researcher / Senior Research Scientist worked at [KISTI](https://www.kisti.re.kr/)’s Large Scale AI Research group (Div of [National Science and Technology Data]). I worked on AI for Science (Situation awareness and decision support with large-scale AI models (Visual LLM)), Computer vision for 3D medical imaging models (CT/MRI/Ultrasound) for virtual human body representation [Digital Twin] 

`Academic Journey`
During my Ph.D. research at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html), I explored of machine learning for robotics and automation (self-driving cars). My work was sensor fusion and drivable region estimation. My findings have been published in esteemed IEEE Transactions journals and conferences.

`My Mission`
I am continuously exploring myself to see where I can contribute to [AI for Science].

Feel free to explore my [CV](/cv/), [GitHub](https://github.com/smmmmi) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Z7CMLAwAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) profiles for more details about my research and contributions.
